"""
Every store, variable name and time window the gallery touches.

This file exists so that a renamed variable or a re-published store is one
edit rather than eight. If an example fails with a ``KeyError`` on a
variable, the fix belongs here and nowhere else.

The windows are short on purpose. ERA5 at hourly resolution has close to a
million time steps; an example that forgets to slice time before doing
anything else is not a minimal example, it is an outage.
