Meridional means, and why they are harder

The previous example got a zonal mean for nothing, because HEALPix is built
out of rings of constant latitude. It is tempting to assume the transpose
works too, and that averaging along a meridian is equally free.

It is not, and the reason is worth a page: HEALPix has rows but no columns.
Each ring is rotated relative to the one below it, and rings hold different
numbers of cells, so no set of cells lines up along a meridian. A meridional
mean has to be binned, which makes it the first operation in this gallery
that involves a choice you have to defend.

# already the area weighted mean over that wedge, which removes the one part
# of binning that usually goes wrong.
#
# What remains is the bin width, and it is a real trade-off: too wide and
# you smear features, too narrow and the bin counts become erratic, because
# a narrow wedge collects a different number of cells from each ring it
# crosses.

# ## Choosing the width
#
# A defensible default is one bin per cell width at the **coarsest** ring in
# your band, which at level `k` is `360 / (4 * 2**k)` degrees in the
# equatorial belt and wider towards the poles. At level 4 that is 5.6
# degrees, so 64 bins around the globe; the 96-bin curve above is finer than
# that, and its wiggle is the grid talking rather than the atmosphere.
#
# The same rule at level 7 gives 512 bins, which is the sense in which this
# problem goes away with resolution. It never quite disappears, though, and
# the honest summary is this: HEALPix is an excellent grid for anything that
# respects the sphere's symmetry, and a slightly awkward one for anything
# phrased in terms of a rectangular lattice. Knowing which of the two you
# are doing is most of the skill.
