## Why HEALPix?

HEALPix (Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelisation) tiles the
sphere into pixels of exactly equal area at every resolution level.
Originally developed for mapping the cosmic microwave background, it
turns out to be exactly what analysis-ready climate data needs.

## Area-weighted statistics are trivial

Every pixel covers the same solid angle, so a global mean is just the
arithmetic mean of all pixels. No latitude-dependent cosine weighting
is needed, and an entire class of subtle statistics bugs, forgotten
or misapplied area weights, simply cannot occur.

!!! note "Fields with missing values"
    This holds for complete fields.  For fields with NaNs (ocean-only
    variables, sea ice, observation gaps), a coarse cell can be partly
    valid, and its value is the mean over that valid part only.  Averages
    over coarse levels then need the valid fraction of each cell as a
    weight;

areas shrink with latitude; on a comparable 0.25° grid the largest
cell is more than 400 times bigger than the smallest. On HEALPix
(right), every cell is identical by construction.
///

## No singularities at the poles

Regular lat-lon grids have converging meridians and vanishing cell
areas at the poles, which force special-case handling in numerics,
storage, and visualisation. HEALPix cells run right through the pole
without anything special happening there.

HEALPix tessellation is unremarkable there, which is the point.
///

## Nested ordering

HEALPix defines two pixel numbering schemes: **ring** ordering (pixels
numbered along iso-latitude rings) and **nested** ordering (pixels
numbered by a hierarchical quad-tree).  The remapping procedure[^1] defaults to nested ordering because it makes coarsening free.

In nested ordering, a parent pixel at level $L$ with index $i$ has
children $4i$, $4i+1$, $4i+2$, $4i+3$ at level $L+1$.  Coarsening
the full grid therefore reduces to reshaping the data array from
$(n_\text{cells},)$ to $(n_\text{cells} / 4,\; 4)$ and reducing along
the last axis, requiring no index lookup, no scatter, and no sorting.

The indices are the actual nested indices: children of parent *p* are
*4p* to *4p+3*.
///


HEALPix also supports ring ordering, but it does not have contiguous
parent-child layout. Our remapping software[^1] supports it, but in
that mode  every pyramid level is independently remapped from the
source grid, which is substantially more expensive.


## Sphere or ellipsoid

HEALPix can be defined on a perfect sphere, the original
construction[^gorski], or on the WGS84 ellipsoid[^wgs84], where the cell
boundaries are laid out in authalic latitude so that cells stay
equal-area on the ellipsoid[^gibb][^hpgeo].  grid-doctor uses the sphere
by default.

Both definitions give the same results with
[ESMF](https://earthsystemmodeling.org/regrid/), even though ESMF
computes all overlap areas on the sphere[^esmf].  healpix-geo returns the
cell vertices of either definition in geodetic coordinates, the same
coordinates the source data uses, so source and target mesh always
share one coordinate space; the ellipsoidal definition only moves where
the cell boundaries lie.  The remaining distortion of the sphere
approximation affects the numerator and denominator of every
conservative weight[^jones] almost equally and cancels to a relative
error of about $10^{-5}$ at level 10, smaller at finer levels.

What does not work is converting a remapped product from one definition
to the other.  Re-binning already averaged cells onto displaced cells
adds a second interpolation step and roughly doubles the error.
Products for either definition should always be remapped from the
native data.

| Route | Product | RMS error | × local contrast |
|:--|:--|--:|--:|
| A | native → spherical HEALPix | 0.0840 K | 0.94 |
| B | native → ellipsoidal (WGS84) HEALPix | 0.0841 K | 0.94 |
| C | A converted to ellipsoidal | 0.1639 K | 1.84 |

level 10 (about 6.4 km) with ESMF conservative weights, about 2.66
million ocean cells.  Each route is scored against a reference that bins
the native pixels directly into cells of the same definition.  The local
contrast (median spread within groups of four neighbouring cells,
0.089 K) is the relevant scale because remapping errors live at the cell
scale.  A and B agree within 1 % between 60° S and 45° N and within 5 %
poleward of that.
///

### Different definitions are different grids

Two datasets on HEALPix at the same level are not on the same grid
unless they use the same definition.  The same cell index denotes a
different patch of the Earth under the two definitions, displaced by
the difference between geodetic and authalic latitude[^snyder]:

$$
\varphi - \xi \approx \tfrac{e^2}{3} \sin 2\varphi
\quad (\text{max } 7.7' \approx 14\ \mathrm{km\ at}\ 45°),
$$

with WGS84 eccentricity $e^2 \approx 0.006694$.  That is about 2 cell
widths at level 10, 9 at level 12 and 18 at level 13; at level 10,
99.8 % of all cells have a different index under the two definitions.

Data on different definitions must therefore not be compared, overlaid
or differenced cell by cell, and cells must not be located with the
other definition (for example `lonlat_to_healpix` with a different
ellipsoid than the data was produced with).  Otherwise the field appears
shifted by up to 14 km: fronts, coastlines and swath edges land in the
wrong cells.  To compare such datasets, remap both from their native
data onto the same definition.

## Target level selection

The target HEALPix level for each source dataset is chosen as the
highest level whose characteristic pixel spacing is coarser than or
comparable to the source resolution.  The heuristic is:

$$
\ell = \left\lfloor \log_2 \frac{58.6°}{\Delta} \right\rfloor
$$

where $\Delta$ is the estimated source grid spacing in degrees.  The
constant 58.6° is the approximate pixel spacing at level 0,
derived from $360° \;/\; \sqrt{12 \times 4^0}$.

This ensures that the HEALPix grid does not oversample the source.
Lower pyramid levels are derived by coarsening, not by remapping, so
no additional information is fabricated.

| Level | nside | Pixels       | Approx. spacing |
|------:|------:|-------------:|:---------------:|
|     0 |     1 |           12 | 58.6°           |
|     3 |     8 |          768 | 7.3°            |
|     5 |    32 |       12 288 | 1.8°            |
|     7 |   128 |      196 608 | 27.5′           |
|     9 |   512 |    3 145 728 | 6.9′            |
|    10 |  1024 |   12 582 912 | 3.4′            |


## Remapping methods

Remapping is performed by ESMF, which computes the geometric overlap
between source and target cells and produces a sparse weight matrix
that is applied to the data.  The remapping software supports two remapping
methods, chosen by variable type.

### Conservative remapping (continuous fields)

Used for temperature, precipitation, radiation, wind, and all other
fields that represent continuous physical quantities.

Conservative remapping computes area-weighted averages: each weight is
proportional to the fractional overlap area between a source cell and a
target cell.  The key property is **integral preservation**, the
area-integral of the field over any target cell equals the sum of the
area-integrals of the contributing source cells.

This is the only method that correctly handles sub-pixel variability.
If a HEALPix cell straddles a strong SST gradient, the conservative
average reflects the true area-weighted mean rather than the value at a
single sampled point.

### Nearest-neighbour remapping (categorical fields)

Used for land-sea masks, land cover classes, soil type, and all other
fields where values are discrete labels.

Nearest-neighbour assigns each target cell the value of the closest
source cell centre.  This guarantees that the output contains only
values that actually exist in the source, no interpolated intermediate
classes like "land-use 3.7" can appear.

Linear or bilinear interpolation is explicitly **not** supported.  While
it can produce smoother-looking fields, it fabricates values that were
not present in the original data.


## Weight generation

Remapping weights are precomputed and stored as reusable NetCDF files.
Weight generation is the most expensive step in the pipeline, but it
only needs to happen once per combination of source grid and target
HEALPix level.  Subsequent runs reuse the cached weight file.

For moderate grids, weights are generated in memory using ESMF's Python
bindings (ESMPy).  For very large grids where this would exceed
available RAM, grid-doctor[^1] writes both meshes to temporary files and
invokes the standalone `ESMF_RegridWeightGen` command under MPI, with a
configurable number of ranks.

Grid-doctor[^1] automatically classifies the source grid and constructs the
appropriate mesh representation:

| Source type     | Examples                    | Detection |
|:----------------|:----------------------------|:----------|
| Regular         | ERA5, CMIP on lat-lon grids | 1-D `lat` and `lon` coordinates |
| Curvilinear     | NEMO, WRF                   | 2-D `lat(y, x)` and `lon(y, x)` |
| Unstructured    | ICON, MPAS                  | Dimension named `cell` / `ncells`, or `CDI_grid_type` attribute |

Every weight file is annotated with provenance metadata
(`grid_doctor_method`, `grid_doctor_level`, `grid_doctor_order`, source
grid details) so that downstream tools can verify how the weights were
produced.


## Weight application

Applying the weight matrix to data is a sparse matrix multiplication.
The full batch of time steps is reshaped into a single dense matrix and
multiplied in one operation, which is typically 10–50× faster than
applying the weights one time step at a time.  GPU acceleration (via
CuPy) and JIT compilation (via Numba) are used automatically when those
packages are installed.  See
[Performance: application backends](#performance-application-backends)
for details.


## Missing-value handling during remapping

Source datasets commonly contain NaN values, for instance land pixels in
an ocean dataset, gaps in satellite swaths, or masked regions.  The
`missing_policy` parameter controls how these are treated during weight
application.

### Renormalize (default)

Source cells that are NaN are excluded from the weighted sum.  The
weights of the remaining valid source cells are rescaled so they sum
to 1.  A target cell receives a valid value as long as at least one
contributing source cell is valid.

This is the appropriate choice for virtually all climate fields.  A
HEALPix cell on a coastline that partly overlaps land (NaN) and partly
ocean still receives a valid SST from the ocean fraction.

### Propagate

If any contributing source cell is NaN, the target cell is set to NaN.
No partial averages are computed.

This mode exists for strict budget-closure applications.  If you are
integrating total precipitation over a HEALPix cell and one source cell
is missing, the renormalized average looks valid but represents a biased
estimate over a subset of the area.  For budget-closure studies it is
preferable to have a NaN than a plausible-looking number derived from
incomplete coverage.

Note that this mode is very aggressive: a single NaN source cell at the
edge of a target cell's footprint is enough to discard it.  Along
coastlines, swath edges, and orbit gaps, large portions of the output
will be NaN.


## Point binning (swath and station data)

Gridded datasets are remapped with ESMF as described above.  *Point-sampled*
data — satellite Level-2 swaths, station records, trajectories — cannot use
that path for two structural reasons: every granule has unique geometry, so
the precomputed weight matrix can never be reused, and ESMF's
nearest source-to-destination method assigns a value to **every**
destination cell, which would smear a narrow swath over the entire globe.

Point data is therefore **binned**: each sample is assigned to the HEALPix
cell containing its coordinates and all samples per cell are reduced.  The
available reductions mirror the two remapping methods:

- **Mean binning (continuous fields).**  In the oversampled limit — sample
  spacing much finer than the target cell spacing — the per-cell sample
  mean converges to the area-weighted mean, making it a first-order
  approximation of conservative remapping.  This validity condition is
  enforced by choosing the target level from the sample spacing with the
  same heuristic used for gridded data; a swath is never binned into cells
  finer than its own pixel spacing.
- **Mode binning (categorical fields).**  The most frequent class per cell,
  the binning analogue of nearest-neighbour remapping.  Ties are broken
  deterministically towards the lowest class value.  As with
  nearest-neighbour remapping, no interpolated intermediate classes can
  appear.
- ``min`` / ``max`` / ``count`` are available for extrema and coverage
  diagnostics.

A per-sample **sum is deliberately not offered**: it scales with sample
density (orbit overlap, across-track pixel count) rather than any physical
integral, and therefore violates the integral-preservation rationale that
motivates conservative remapping.  Root-mean-square reductions are likewise
excluded because they do not commute with mean coarsening in the pyramid;
if an RMS quantity is required, bin the *squared* field with the mean and
apply the square root at read time.

### Sphere, also for satellite data

Satellite geolocation is geodetic (WGS84).  Binning indexes cells on the
**perfect sphere**, like remapping, by assigning each geodetic position
to the cell that contains it; this is as accurate as binning on the
ellipsoid (see [Sphere or ellipsoid](#sphere-or-ellipsoid)).  Data
binned on one definition is not comparable cell by cell with data on the
other: the cells are displaced by up to ~0.13° (~14 km) at 45° latitude,
several to dozens of pixels at typical swath target levels.

### Minimum sample count and coverage tracking

A cell is set to NaN when it receives fewer than ``min_count`` valid
samples (default: 1).  Optionally, a companion ``<variable>_count``
variable records the number of valid samples per cell.  Publishing the
count is recommended: it makes coverage auditable, enables unbiased
count-weighted merging of overlapping granules, and is the point-data
analogue of a valid-area fraction for coarsened grids.

### Pyramids from binned data

Binned datasets carry the full standard metadata (``crs`` variable,
``healpix_*`` and ``grid_doctor_*`` attributes) and dense cell layout, so
pyramid construction reuses the ordinary coarsening machinery unchanged,
including the 50% minimum-valid-fraction rule.  The recorded method
(``grid_doctor_method = "binned-mean"`` or ``"binned-mode"``) drives the
automatic mean-vs-mode coarsening selection, just as ``"conservative"``
and ``"nearest"`` do for remapped data.


## Pyramid construction and coarsening

The multi-resolution pyramid is built by first remapping the source
dataset to the finest HEALPix level, then deriving all coarser levels
by iterated coarsening, one level at a time, always a factor of 4.
Every level builds on the previous one, so the whole pyramid is a single
lazy computation (see
[Chunked application and single-pass writes](#chunked-application-and-single-pass-writes)).

### Why coarsen rather than remap at each level?

Remapping from the original source grid at every level would be correct
but wasteful: each level would require a separate weight file, and
weight generation cost scales with the product of source and target
cell counts.  Coarsening is essentially free, a reshape plus a
vectorised reduction, and produces identical results for nested
HEALPix grids because the nested pixel hierarchy exactly matches the
coarsening hierarchy.

### Mean coarsening (continuous fields)

For continuous fields (those remapped with conservative weights), each
coarse cell's value is the mean over **all valid finest-level cells**
beneath it.  This is not the same as the mean of its 4 children once
children are only partly valid: a child built from a single valid
finest-level cell would otherwise count as much as a child built from
four.  Repeated over several levels, that mean of means drifts away from
the finest level.

The pyramid therefore carries two running totals per cell instead of a
mean: the sum of the valid finest-level values and their count.  Both
coarsen exactly by summing groups of 4, and the mean is only formed when
a level is written:

$$
\bar{x}_\text{parent} = \frac{\sum_{c} s_c}{\sum_{c} n_c},
\qquad s_c = \sum_{\text{valid } i \in c} x_i, \quad n_c = \#\{\text{valid } i \in c\}
$$

Every level is therefore identical to coarsening directly from the
finest level, while each step stays a local reduction of 4 neighbouring
cells.

### Mode coarsening (categorical fields)

For categorical fields (those remapped with nearest-neighbour weights),
averaging class labels is meaningless.  Instead, each parent cell
receives the **mode** (most frequent value) of its valid children.
Ties are broken by the first occurrence.

The coarsening mode is inferred automatically from the remapping method
stored in the dataset attributes: `grid_doctor_method = "nearest"`
triggers mode coarsening, `"conservative"` triggers mean coarsening.
An explicit `coarsen_mode` parameter is available to override this.

Unlike the mean, a mode of modes is not the mode of all finest-level
cells, and mode coarsening is applied level by level, with the minimum
valid fraction checked against the 4 children at each step.

### Minimum valid fraction (default: 50%)

For mean coarsening, a cell is set to NaN when fewer than half of the
**finest-level** cells beneath it are valid.  The threshold is applied to
this cumulative fraction, not to the 4 children of each step.

**Representativeness.**  A cell's value should represent the majority
of its area.  Because the threshold uses the finest-level count, the
value is guaranteed to cover at least half of the cell's area at every
level.  A per-step rule could not guarantee this: 2 valid children out
of 4, each built from 2 valid children out of 4, cover only a quarter of
the area two levels up.  Below the threshold, a few pixels' values would
"speak for" an area that has no data, which is indistinguishable from
interpolation into unknown territory.

Cells masked by the threshold keep their running sums and counts, so
their valid data still contributes to coarser levels where it is part of
a majority.

**Cascade prevention.**  Each coarsening step is a factor-of-4
reduction.  If only 1 of 4 valid children were sufficient, a single
valid pixel at the finest level could survive every coarsening step:
1/4 at level $N-1$, that surviving parent is again 1/4 at level $N-2$,
and so on.  After $k$ steps it represents a fraction of $4^{-k}$ of the
area it claims to cover.  This is the "Siberian lake problem" observed
with MODIS SST: a single lake pixel at level 10 bled through 7
coarsening steps to level 3, covering a 16 384× larger area.  With a
50% threshold, the cascade is impossible, the pixel is discarded at
the very first step because 1/4 < 1/2.  A feature can only survive
coarsening if it covers at least half the area at every scale, which is
exactly when it is a real, resolvable feature at that resolution.

The threshold is configurable with `min_valid_fraction`.  Set it to `0`
to keep every cell that contains any valid data, for instance when the
coarse levels are only used for weighted aggregates.

### Averaging over coarse levels: valid fractions

Because every coarse value is a mean over its valid area, a plain mean
over coarse cells weights a coastal cell that is 10% ocean as much as an
open-ocean cell.  The level-to-level consistency of the pyramid only
holds for means weighted by the number of valid finest-level cells:
with two coarse cells, one fully valid at 10 °C (4 valid cells) and one
with a single valid cell at 20 °C, the finest-level mean is
(4 × 10 + 20) / 5 = 12 °C, while the plain mean of the two coarse values
is 15 °C.  Both coarse values are correct; the plain average is not.

The weights cannot be folded into the stored values without losing their
meaning (a coastal cell would no longer hold the SST of its ocean
part).  Instead, the pyramid can store them alongside:

```python
pyramid = gd.create_healpix_pyramid(ds, valid_fraction=True)
```

adds `<name>_valid_fraction` (float32, fraction of valid finest-level
cells, linked through the CF `ancillary_variables` attribute) to every
level, including the finest one.  Global or regional means then agree
across all levels:

```python
ds = pyramid[3]
ds.sst.weighted(ds.sst_valid_fraction.fillna(0)).mean("cell")
```

The option is opt-in because the fraction has the shape of its variable:

- `True` stores a fraction for every cell variable, with its full shape.
  This is correct for masks that change over time or height (sea ice,
  clouds, orography on pressure levels).
- `"static"` stores a single `cell`-only fraction taken from the first
  time step / level.  It is tiny, but only correct when the mask never
  changes, as for a land-sea mask.
- A list of names, or a mapping such as `{"sst": "static", "ice": True}`,
  restricts the fractions to selected variables.

Fractions are mostly exactly 0 or 1 and compress well; in a test with 8
time steps the full-shape fractions added about 7% to the store, the
static ones under 1%.  This mirrors the `ocean_fraction` variables of
the nextGEMS HEALPix output.


## Output metadata and CRS convention

Every output dataset carries a standardised set of metadata.

### Global attributes

| Attribute                          | Description |
|:-----------------------------------|:------------|
| `healpix_level`                    | HEALPix refinement level |
| `healpix_nside`                    | $2^\ell$ |
| `healpix_order`                    | `nested` or `ring` |
| `grid_doctor_version`              | Package version that produced the data |
| `grid_doctor_method`               | `conservative` or `nearest` |
| `grid_doctor_coarsened_from_level` | Level the values were coarsened from: the finest level for pyramids, the input level for `coarsen_healpix` (coarsened levels only) |
| `grid_doctor_coarsen_mode`         | `mean` or `mode` (coarsened levels only) |
| `grid_doctor_min_valid_fraction`   | Threshold below which cells were set to NaN: cumulative over finest-level cells for `mean`, per coarsening step for `mode` (coarsened levels only) |

### CRS variable

A scalar coordinate variable named `crs` follows the CF `grid_mapping`
convention.  It carries attributes that describe the coordinate
reference system:

```
crs: float64
    grid_mapping_name: healpix
    healpix_nside: 1024
    healpix_level: 10
    healpix_order: nested
```

Every spatially-dimensioned data variable carries
`grid_mapping = "crs"` so that CF-aware tools can discover the
projection automatically.  This convention is validated against the
[gridlook](https://gridlook.pages.dev/) viewer, which uses
`grid_mapping_name == "healpix"` to detect and render HEALPix datasets.


## Storage format

Pyramids are written as Zarr v2 stores with consolidated metadata, one
store per level (`level_0.zarr`, `level_1.zarr`, …).  Zarr v2 is used
because ecosystem support for v3 is still maturing: client libraries
such as `zarr-python`, `zarr-js` (used by gridlook and similar web
viewers), `xarray`, and `zarrita` have stable, well-tested v2
implementations, while v3 support varies in completeness.  The
transition to v3 is planned once the client ecosystem has converged.

Zarr's chunked, cloud-native layout enables byte-range reads from S3
without downloading entire files, which is essential for interactive
visualisation where only a single chunk of a single variable at a single
level needs to be fetched.



## High-level regional datasets: implicit coordinates

Small-area datasets at very high levels (16 and beyond) keep the dense
global convention — cell position equals cell index — but stop
materialising what the index already implies.  Above level
10 (`WRITE_COORDS_MAX_LEVEL`), stores are written **without**
`cell`/`latitude`/`longitude` coordinate arrays: at level 16 those two
float64 arrays would cost ~800 GB while the regional payload is
megabytes, and unlike the data variables they are never fill values, so
empty-chunk elision cannot help.  Such stores carry
`grid_doctor_implicit_coords = 1`, retain the `crs` variable and all
`healpix_*` attributes, and remain byte-identical in layout to an
ordinary dense store.

Access is region-driven through range selection.  Nested ordering
guarantees that every coarse-level parent corresponds to one contiguous
fine-level index range, so a bounding-box query decomposes into a
handful of contiguous reads that align one-to-one with power-of-four
chunks.  Coordinates are reconstructed on the fly for exactly the cells
returned.  Combined with `fill_value = NaN` and empty-chunk elision on
the data variables, storage and access cost are proportional to the
domain, not the globe, while cross-dataset and cross-level alignment
stay a bit-shift (`parent = id >> 2k`) exactly as for every other
nested HEALPix dataset.

Levels at or below the threshold within the same pyramid are written
with materialised coordinates as usual, so coarse overview levels stay
directly consumable by CF-aware viewers.

## Performance: application backends

The sparse weight-matrix multiplication supports three backends,
selected automatically based on what is installed.

**Batched SciPy** (always available) reshapes all time steps into a
single dense matrix and performs one sparse matmul, delegating to BLAS
for the dense side.  This is typically 10–50× faster than per-slice
application.

**Numba** (optional) JIT-compiles a fused kernel that computes the
weighted sum, NaN mask, and renormalization in a single pass over the
sparse matrix structure.  This halves memory traffic for single-slice
workloads.

**CuPy** (optional) transfers the weight matrix to the GPU once and
applies it via cuSPARSE.  This is worthwhile for large target grids
(HEALPix level 10+) with many time steps, where the transfer cost is
amortised over the batch.

The backend can be overridden explicitly via `backend="scipy"`,
`"numba"`, or `"cupy"` in any remapping call.

### Chunked application and single-pass writes

For dask-backed input, the regridded field is chunked along `cell`
(`cell_chunks`, by default 4^10 cells).  Rows of the weight matrix are
independent, so each output chunk is computed from its own block of
matrix rows; the blocks share the matrix memory instead of copying it.
No task holds the whole HEALPix field, and the coarser levels keep the
same chunking because every coarsening step only combines groups of 4
neighbouring cells.

Inside dask tasks the Numba kernels run single-threaded: dask already
runs many tasks in parallel, and a multi-threaded kernel per task would
start one thread team per task and exhaust the process thread limit on
many-core nodes.  Without dask, the multi-threaded kernels are used.

`save_pyramid` writes all levels in a single computation, so the
regridding of each finest-level chunk runs exactly once and is shared by
all coarser levels.  Computing levels separately (for example
`pyramid[5].compute()` followed by `pyramid[4].compute()`) regrids the
source again each time; `persist()` the finest level when exploring
interactively.
