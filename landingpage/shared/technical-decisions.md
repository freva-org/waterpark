technical choices in the remapping process that is applied to create all
datasets[^1].  It is intended as a reference for

## Why HEALPix?

HEALPix (Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelisation) tiles the
sphere into pixels of exactly equal area at every resolution level.
Originally developed for mapping the cosmic microwave background, it
turns out to be exactly what analysis-ready climate data needs.

## Area-weighted statistics are trivial

Every pixel covers the same solid angle, so a global mean is just the
arithmetic mean of all pixels. No latitude-dependent cosine weighting
is needed, and an entire class of subtle statistics bugs, forgotten
or misapplied area weights, simply cannot occur.

areas shrink with latitude; on a comparable 0.25° grid the largest
cell is more than 400 times bigger than the smallest. On HEALPix
(right), every cell is identical by construction.
///

## No singularities at the poles

Regular lat-lon grids have converging meridians and vanishing cell
areas at the poles, which force special-case handling in numerics,
storage, and visualisation. HEALPix cells run right through the pole
without anything special happening there.

## Nested ordering

HEALPix defines two pixel numbering schemes: **ring** ordering (pixels
numbered along iso-latitude rings) and **nested** ordering (pixels
numbered by a hierarchical quad-tree).  The remapping procedure[^1] defaults to nested ordering because it makes coarsening free.

In nested ordering, a parent pixel at level $L$ with index $i$ has
children $4i$, $4i+1$, $4i+2$, $4i+3$ at level $L+1$.  Coarsening
the full grid therefore reduces to reshaping the data array from
$(n_\text{cells},)$ to $(n_\text{cells} / 4,\; 4)$ and reducing along
the last axis, requiring no index lookup, no scatter, and no sorting.

*4p* to *4p+3*.
///


HEALPix also supports ring ordering, but it does not have contiguous
parent-child layout. Our remapping software[^1] supports it, but in
that mode  every pyramid level is independently remapped from the
source grid, which is substantially more expensive.


## Spherical geometry

All HEALPix cell boundaries and centre coordinates are computed on a
**perfect sphere**, not on the WGS84 ellipsoid[^wgs84].  The remapping
software we use,
[ESMF](https://earthsystemmodeling.org/regrid/) (Earth System Modeling
Framework, a widely used library for regridding Earth-system model
output), computes conservative overlap areas exclusively on the sphere,
with great-circle cell edges; it has no ellipsoidal geometry
mode[^esmf].  The HEALPix target mesh, the source mesh, and the overlap
calculation therefore all use one and the same geometry.

**Plain-language summary.**  It is tempting to think that a spherical
pipeline is "off by up to 21 km" compared to the real, slightly
flattened Earth, and that switching the grid definition to the WGS84
ellipsoid would fix this.  Neither is true.  As long as *every* step of
the pipeline uses the same convention, the sphere approximation cancels
out of the remapping almost entirely: the residual error is a few parts
per million.  The 14 to 21 km error only becomes real when conventions
are *mixed*, that is, when an ellipsoid-defined grid is fed into a
sphere-based remapping tool (or vice versa).  Adopting ellipsoidal
HEALPix today, while ESMF and the rest of the regridding ecosystem
remain spherical, would create exactly that mixed state.  It would
*introduce* a systematic geolocation error of up to about 14 km, many
pixel widths at kilometre-scale resolution, into a change whose stated
motivation is geolocation accuracy.  Consistency beats fidelity.

### Why the sphere approximation cancels

Everyone's data carries geodetic (WGS84) latitude $\varphi$.  Our
pipeline interprets $\varphi$ directly as spherical latitude, a smooth
and invertible convention applied identically to the source grid and
the HEALPix target.  Because both grids are transformed the same way,
their overlap topology in $(\lambda, \varphi)$ space is preserved
exactly; a geodetic position round-trips to the same HEALPix cell
without loss.

The only distortion is the *area measure*.  On the sphere the area
element is $dA_s = R^2 \cos\varphi \, d\varphi \, d\lambda$; on the
ellipsoid it is $dA_e = M(\varphi) N(\varphi) \cos\varphi \, d\varphi
\, d\lambda$, with the meridional and prime-vertical radii of
curvature[^snyder]

$$
M(\varphi) = \frac{a (1 - e^2)}{(1 - e^2 \sin^2\varphi)^{3/2}},
\qquad
N(\varphi) = \frac{a}{(1 - e^2 \sin^2\varphi)^{1/2}},
$$

and WGS84 eccentricity $e^2 = f(2-f) \approx 0.006694$[^wgs84].  Write
the distortion ratio $\rho(\varphi) = dA_e / dA_s$.  A first-order
conservative remapping weight is a **ratio of areas**[^jones],


$$
w_{ij} \;=\; \frac{A(S_i \cap T_j)}{A(T_j)},
$$


where $S_i$ is cell $i$ of the source grid (for example an ICON
triangle or a satellite pixel footprint), $T_j$ is target HEALPix cell
$j$, and $A(\cdot)$ denotes area.  The weight $w_{ij}$ is the fraction
of the target cell covered by that source cell, and the remapped field
is the weighted average $\tilde f_j = \sum_i w_{ij} f_i$.  Numerator
and denominator sample $\rho$ at the *same latitude*, so the distortion
cancels to first order:


$$
w_{ij}^{\mathrm{sphere}}
= \frac{\displaystyle\int_{S_i \cap T_j} \rho^{-1}\, dA_e}
       {\displaystyle\int_{T_j} \rho^{-1}\, dA_e}
= w_{ij}^{\mathrm{ellipsoid}}
  \left( 1 + \mathcal{O}\!\left(\tfrac{\rho'}{\rho}\,
  \Delta\varphi_{\mathrm{cell}} \right) \right).
$$

The residual scales with the *variation* of $\rho$ across a single
cell, $\rho'/\rho \sim 2 e^2 \sin 2\varphi \approx 0.013$ per radian.
For a level-10 HEALPix cell ($\Delta\varphi_{\mathrm{cell}} \approx 5.4
\times 10^{-4}$ rad) the relative weight error is

$$
\varepsilon_{\mathrm{consistent}}
\;\sim\; 2 e^2 \, \Delta\varphi_{\mathrm{cell}}
\;\approx\; 7 \times 10^{-6},
$$

and it *shrinks* with increasing resolution.  What does not cancel is
the absolute area of a cell: integrating with spherical cell areas over
ellipsoidal data carries a smooth latitude-dependent bias
$\rho(\varphi) - 1$ of roughly $-0.4\,\%$ at the equator to $+0.9\,\%$
at the poles.  This affects diagnostics, not remapping, and is fully
correctable in post-processing by integrating with true ellipsoidal
cell areas.

### Why mixing conventions does not cancel

An ellipsoidal HEALPix grid keeps its cells equal-area on the ellipsoid
by defining cell boundaries through an auxiliary latitude[^snyder].
Suitable choices are the authalic latitude $\xi$ (the construction used
by the rHEALPix DGGS on the ellipsoid[^gibb] and by healpix-geo's WGS84
support[^hpgeo]) or, for pure geolocation, the geocentric latitude
$\psi$:

$$
\varphi - \xi \approx \tfrac{e^2}{3} \sin 2\varphi
\quad (\text{max } 7.7' \approx 14\ \mathrm{km}),
\qquad
\varphi - \psi \approx \tfrac{e^2}{2} \sin 2\varphi
\quad (\text{max } 11.5' \approx 21\ \mathrm{km}),
$$

both maximal at $\varphi = 45°$.  Feed such a grid into a spherical
remapper together with a source grid whose coordinates are plain
geodetic latitudes, and the two grids are now expressed in *different*
latitude conventions: the target is displaced relative to the source by
$\delta\varphi(\varphi)$.  Conservative overlaps are then computed
between systematically misregistered polygons, and the remapped field
is, to first order, the true field evaluated at a shifted position:

$$
\tilde f(\mathbf{x}) \;\approx\; f(\mathbf{x} + \boldsymbol{\delta}),
\qquad |\boldsymbol{\delta}| \lesssim 14\text{ to }21\ \mathrm{km}.
$$

Unlike the consistent case, this error is **first order** in $e^2$ and
is a *displacement*, the worst kind of error for high-resolution data:
HEALPix cells measure roughly 6.4 km at level 10, 1.6 km at level 12,
and 0.8 km at level 13, so the misregistration amounts to **10 to 20
cell widths** at kilometre scale.  Every front, coastline, and swath
edge lands in the wrong cells.  Comparing the two regimes at level 12:

$$
\frac{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{mixed}}}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{consistent}}}
\;\sim\;
\frac{e^2/3}{2 e^2 \, \Delta\varphi_{\mathrm{cell}}}
\;=\;
\frac{1}{6\,\Delta\varphi_{\mathrm{cell}}}
\;\approx\; 10^3 .
$$

Switching the grid definition without switching the remapping stack
makes the error roughly **three orders of magnitude larger** than
staying consistently spherical.

### Migration path

Ellipsoidal HEALPix is not wrong, it is premature.  The correct
construction defines the grid through the authalic latitude, following
the rHEALPix ellipsoidal DGGS[^gibb] and healpix-geo[^hpgeo].  Because
the authalic mapping is equal-area by construction[^snyder], a
spherical conservative remapping performed in authalic coordinates is
*exactly* area-preserving on the ellipsoid; the only residual is the
difference between great-circle edges and images of ellipsoidal
geodesics, which is $\mathcal{O}(e^4)$.  A correct ellipsoidal pipeline
therefore requires the transform $\varphi \to \xi(\varphi)$ to be
applied to the source mesh before weight generation, either inside the
remapping tool (an ellipsoid-aware ESMF or equivalent) or consistently
in every tool that touches the data, including downstream cell lookups.

A half-migrated ecosystem is strictly worse than either pure
convention.  Our commitment is therefore:

1. **Today**: all geometry (HEALPix boundaries[^gorski], source
   meshes, ESMF overlap calculation) stays on the perfect sphere,
   with geodetic latitude interpreted as spherical latitude end to end.
2. **When** an ellipsoid-aware conservative remapping tool is available
   and validated (a new ESMF version or an equivalent that applies the
   authalic transform internally), we switch the pipeline **and remap
   all published datasets** in one coordinated step, so that no dataset
   ever mixes conventions with another.


## Target level selection

The target HEALPix level for each source dataset is chosen as the
highest level whose characteristic pixel spacing is coarser than or
comparable to the source resolution.  The heuristic is:

$$
\ell = \left\lfloor \log_2 \frac{58.6°}{\Delta} \right\rfloor
$$

where $\Delta$ is the estimated source grid spacing in degrees.  The
constant 58.6° is the approximate pixel spacing at level 0,
derived from $360° \;/\; \sqrt{12 \times 4^0}$.

This ensures that the HEALPix grid does not oversample the source.
Lower pyramid levels are derived by coarsening, not by remapping, so
no additional information is fabricated.

| Level | nside | Pixels       | Approx. spacing |
|------:|------:|-------------:|:---------------:|
|     0 |     1 |           12 | 58.6°           |
|     3 |     8 |          768 | 7.3°            |
|     5 |    32 |       12 288 | 1.8°            |
|     7 |   128 |      196 608 | 27.5′           |
|     9 |   512 |    3 145 728 | 6.9′            |
|    10 |  1024 |   12 582 912 | 3.4′            |


## Remapping methods

Remapping is performed by ESMF, which computes the geometric overlap
between source and target cells and produces a sparse weight matrix
that is applied to the data.  The remapping software supports two remapping
methods, chosen by variable type.

### Conservative remapping (continuous fields)

Used for temperature, precipitation, radiation, wind, and all other
fields that represent continuous physical quantities.

Conservative remapping computes area-weighted averages: each weight is
proportional to the fractional overlap area between a source cell and a
target cell.  The key property is **integral preservation**, the
area-integral of the field over any target cell equals the sum of the
area-integrals of the contributing source cells.

This is the only method that correctly handles sub-pixel variability.
If a HEALPix cell straddles a strong SST gradient, the conservative
average reflects the true area-weighted mean rather than the value at a
single sampled point.

### Nearest-neighbour remapping (categorical fields)

Used for land-sea masks, land cover classes, soil type, and all other
fields where values are discrete labels.

Nearest-neighbour assigns each target cell the value of the closest
source cell centre.  This guarantees that the output contains only
values that actually exist in the source, no interpolated intermediate
classes like "land-use 3.7" can appear.

Linear or bilinear interpolation is explicitly **not** supported.  While
it can produce smoother-looking fields, it fabricates values that were
not present in the original data.


## Weight generation

Remapping weights are precomputed and stored as reusable NetCDF files.
Weight generation is the most expensive step in the pipeline, but it
only needs to happen once per combination of source grid and target
HEALPix level.  Subsequent runs reuse the cached weight file.

For moderate grids, weights are generated in memory using ESMF's Python
bindings (ESMPy).  For very large grids where this would exceed
available RAM, grid-doctor[^1] writes both meshes to temporary files and
invokes the standalone `ESMF_RegridWeightGen` command under MPI, with a
configurable number of ranks.

Grid-doctor[^1] automatically classifies the source grid and constructs the
appropriate mesh representation:

| Source type     | Examples                    | Detection |
|:----------------|:----------------------------|:----------|
| Regular         | ERA5, CMIP on lat-lon grids | 1-D `lat` and `lon` coordinates |
| Curvilinear     | NEMO, WRF                   | 2-D `lat(y, x)` and `lon(y, x)` |
| Unstructured    | ICON, MPAS                  | Dimension named `cell` / `ncells`, or `CDI_grid_type` attribute |

Every weight file is annotated with provenance metadata
(`grid_doctor_method`, `grid_doctor_level`, `grid_doctor_order`, source
grid details) so that downstream tools can verify how the weights were
produced.


## Weight application

Applying the weight matrix to data is a sparse matrix multiplication.
The full batch of time steps is reshaped into a single dense matrix and
multiplied in one operation, which is typically 10–50× faster than
applying the weights one time step at a time.  GPU acceleration (via
CuPy) and JIT compilation (via Numba) are used automatically when those
packages are installed.  See
[Performance: application backends](#performance-application-backends)
for details.


## Missing-value handling during remapping

Source datasets commonly contain NaN values, for instance land pixels in
an ocean dataset, gaps in satellite swaths, or masked regions.  The
`missing_policy` parameter controls how these are treated during weight
application.

### Renormalize (default)

Source cells that are NaN are excluded from the weighted sum.  The
weights of the remaining valid source cells are rescaled so they sum
to 1.  A target cell receives a valid value as long as at least one
contributing source cell is valid.

This is the appropriate choice for virtually all climate fields.  A
HEALPix cell on a coastline that partly overlaps land (NaN) and partly
ocean still receives a valid SST from the ocean fraction.

### Propagate

If any contributing source cell is NaN, the target cell is set to NaN.
No partial averages are computed.

This mode exists for strict budget-closure applications.  If you are
integrating total precipitation over a HEALPix cell and one source cell
is missing, the renormalized average looks valid but represents a biased
estimate over a subset of the area.  For budget-closure studies it is
preferable to have a NaN than a plausible-looking number derived from
incomplete coverage.

Note that this mode is very aggressive: a single NaN source cell at the
edge of a target cell's footprint is enough to discard it.  Along
coastlines, swath edges, and orbit gaps, large portions of the output
will be NaN.


## Point binning (swath and station data)

Gridded datasets are remapped with ESMF as described above.  *Point-sampled*
data — satellite Level-2 swaths, station records, trajectories — cannot use
that path for two structural reasons: every granule has unique geometry, so
the precomputed weight matrix can never be reused, and ESMF's
nearest source-to-destination method assigns a value to **every**
destination cell, which would smear a narrow swath over the entire globe.

Point data is therefore **binned**: each sample is assigned to the HEALPix
cell containing its coordinates and all samples per cell are reduced.  The
available reductions mirror the two remapping methods:

- **Mean binning (continuous fields).**  In the oversampled limit — sample
  spacing much finer than the target cell spacing — the per-cell sample
  mean converges to the area-weighted mean, making it a first-order
  approximation of conservative remapping.  This validity condition is
  enforced by choosing the target level from the sample spacing with the
  same heuristic used for gridded data; a swath is never binned into cells
  finer than its own pixel spacing.
- **Mode binning (categorical fields).**  The most frequent class per cell,
  the binning analogue of nearest-neighbour remapping.  Ties are broken
  deterministically towards the lowest class value.  As with
  nearest-neighbour remapping, no interpolated intermediate classes can
  appear.
- ``min`` / ``max`` / ``count`` are available for extrema and coverage
  diagnostics.

A per-sample **sum is deliberately not offered**: it scales with sample
density (orbit overlap, across-track pixel count) rather than any physical
integral, and therefore violates the integral-preservation rationale that
motivates conservative remapping.  Root-mean-square reductions are likewise
excluded because they do not commute with mean coarsening in the pyramid;
if an RMS quantity is required, bin the *squared* field with the mean and
apply the square root at read time.

### Sphere, not ellipsoid — also for satellite data

Satellite geolocation is geodetic (WGS84).  Binning nevertheless indexes
cells on the **perfect sphere**, exactly like all remapped datasets.  The
geodetic-vs-spherical latitude discrepancy (up to ~0.19° at 45° latitude,
~21 km) is accepted so that every dataset in the hub shares a single
indexing geometry.  Indexing one dataset on the ellipsoid while all others
use the sphere would shift it by dozens of pixels at typical swath target
levels, producing visible misregistration (offset coastlines) when
datasets are overlaid.

### Minimum sample count and coverage tracking

A cell is set to NaN when it receives fewer than ``min_count`` valid
samples (default: 1).  Optionally, a companion ``<variable>_count``
variable records the number of valid samples per cell.  Publishing the
count is recommended: it makes coverage auditable, enables unbiased
count-weighted merging of overlapping granules, and is the point-data
analogue of a valid-area fraction for coarsened grids.

### Pyramids from binned data

Binned datasets carry the full standard metadata (``crs`` variable,
``healpix_*`` and ``grid_doctor_*`` attributes) and dense cell layout, so
pyramid construction reuses the ordinary coarsening machinery unchanged,
including the 50% minimum-valid-fraction rule.  The recorded method
(``grid_doctor_method = "binned-mean"`` or ``"binned-mode"``) drives the
automatic mean-vs-mode coarsening selection, just as ``"conservative"``
and ``"nearest"`` do for remapped data.


## Pyramid construction and coarsening

The multi-resolution pyramid is built by first remapping the source
dataset to the finest HEALPix level, then deriving all coarser levels
by iterated coarsening, one level at a time, always a factor of 4.

### Why coarsen rather than remap at each level?

Remapping from the original source grid at every level would be correct
but wasteful: each level would require a separate weight file, and
weight generation cost scales with the product of source and target
cell counts.  Coarsening is essentially free, a reshape plus a
vectorised reduction, and produces identical results for nested
HEALPix grids because the nested pixel hierarchy exactly matches the
coarsening hierarchy.

### Mean coarsening (continuous fields)

For continuous fields (those remapped with conservative weights), each
parent cell's value is the NaN-aware mean of its 4 children.

### Mode coarsening (categorical fields)

For categorical fields (those remapped with nearest-neighbour weights),
averaging class labels is meaningless.  Instead, each parent cell
receives the **mode** (most frequent value) of its valid children.
Ties are broken by the first occurrence.

The coarsening mode is inferred automatically from the remapping method
stored in the dataset attributes: `grid_doctor_method = "nearest"`
triggers mode coarsening, `"conservative"` triggers mean coarsening.
An explicit `coarsen_mode` parameter is available to override this.

### Minimum valid fraction (default: 50%)

A parent cell is set to NaN when fewer than half of its children are
valid (at least 2 of 4).

**Representativeness.**  A parent cell's value should represent the
majority of its area.  With at least 2 of 4 valid children, the value
is guaranteed to cover at least half the parent cell's area.  Below
that, a single child pixel's value would "speak for" 3 other pixels
that have no data, which is indistinguishable from interpolation into
unknown territory.

**Cascade prevention.**  Each coarsening step is a factor-of-4
reduction.  If only 1 of 4 valid children were sufficient, a single
valid pixel at the finest level could survive every coarsening step:
1/4 at level $N-1$, that surviving parent is again 1/4 at level $N-2$,
and so on.  After $k$ steps it represents a fraction of $4^{-k}$ of the
area it claims to cover.  This is the "Siberian lake problem" observed
with MODIS SST: a single lake pixel at level 10 bled through 7
coarsening steps to level 3, covering a 16 384× larger area.  With a
50% threshold, the cascade is impossible, the pixel is discarded at
the very first step because 1/4 < 1/2.  A feature can only survive
coarsening if it covers at least half the area at every scale, which is
exactly when it is a real, resolvable feature at that resolution.


## Output metadata and CRS convention

Every output dataset carries a standardised set of metadata.

### Global attributes

| Attribute                          | Description |
|:-----------------------------------|:------------|
| `healpix_level`                    | HEALPix refinement level |
| `healpix_nside`                    | $2^\ell$ |
| `healpix_order`                    | `nested` or `ring` |
| `grid_doctor_version`              | Package version that produced the data |
| `grid_doctor_method`               | `conservative` or `nearest` |
| `grid_doctor_coarsened_from_level` | Immediate parent level (coarsened levels only) |

### CRS variable

A scalar coordinate variable named `crs` follows the CF `grid_mapping`
convention.  It carries attributes that describe the coordinate
reference system:

```
crs: float64
    grid_mapping_name: healpix
    healpix_nside: 1024
    healpix_level: 10
    healpix_order: nested
```

Every spatially-dimensioned data variable carries
`grid_mapping = "crs"` so that CF-aware tools can discover the
projection automatically.  This convention is validated against the
[gridlook](https://gridlook.pages.dev/) viewer, which uses
`grid_mapping_name == "healpix"` to detect and render HEALPix datasets.


## Storage format

Pyramids are written as Zarr v2 stores with consolidated metadata, one
store per level (`level_0.zarr`, `level_1.zarr`, …).  Zarr v2 is used
because ecosystem support for v3 is still maturing: client libraries
such as `zarr-python`, `zarr-js` (used by gridlook and similar web
viewers), `xarray`, and `zarrita` have stable, well-tested v2
implementations, while v3 support varies in completeness.  The
transition to v3 is planned once the client ecosystem has converged.

Zarr's chunked, cloud-native layout enables byte-range reads from S3
without downloading entire files, which is essential for interactive
visualisation where only a single chunk of a single variable at a single
level needs to be fetched.



## High-level regional datasets: implicit coordinates

Small-area datasets at very high levels (16 and beyond) keep the dense
global convention — cell position equals cell index — but stop
materialising what the index already implies.  Above level
10 (`WRITE_COORDS_MAX_LEVEL`), stores are written **without**
`cell`/`latitude`/`longitude` coordinate arrays: at level 16 those two
float64 arrays would cost ~800 GB while the regional payload is
megabytes, and unlike the data variables they are never fill values, so
empty-chunk elision cannot help.  Such stores carry
`grid_doctor_implicit_coords = 1`, retain the `crs` variable and all
`healpix_*` attributes, and remain byte-identical in layout to an
ordinary dense store.

Access is region-driven through range selection.  Nested ordering
guarantees that every coarse-level parent corresponds to one contiguous
fine-level index range, so a bounding-box query decomposes into a
handful of contiguous reads that align one-to-one with power-of-four
chunks.  Coordinates are reconstructed on the fly for exactly the cells
returned.  Combined with `fill_value = NaN` and empty-chunk elision on
the data variables, storage and access cost are proportional to the
domain, not the globe, while cross-dataset and cross-level alignment
stay a bit-shift (`parent = id >> 2k`) exactly as for every other
dataset in the hub.

Levels at or below the threshold within the same pyramid are written
with materialised coordinates as usual, so coarse overview levels stay
directly consumable by CF-aware viewers.

## Performance: application backends

The sparse weight-matrix multiplication supports three backends,
selected automatically based on what is installed.

**Batched SciPy** (always available) reshapes all time steps into a
single dense matrix and performs one sparse matmul, delegating to BLAS
for the dense side.  This is typically 10–50× faster than per-slice
application.

**Numba** (optional) JIT-compiles a fused kernel that computes the
weighted sum, NaN mask, and renormalization in a single pass over the
sparse matrix structure.  This halves memory traffic for single-slice
workloads.

**CuPy** (optional) transfers the weight matrix to the GPU once and
applies it via cuSPARSE.  This is worthwhile for large target grids
(HEALPix level 10+) with many time steps, where the transfer cost is
amortised over the batch.

The backend can be overridden explicitly via `backend="scipy"`,
`"numba"`, or `"cupy"` in any remapping call.
