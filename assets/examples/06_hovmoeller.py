A Hovmöller diagram

A Hovmöller plot collapses one space dimension and keeps time, which makes
it the natural next step once zonal means work. It is also where picking the
right corner of the pyramid stops being an optimisation and starts being the
difference between a figure and a coffee break.

# %% [md]
# ## Pick the frequency before the level
#
# The hub is a pyramid in time as well as in space. The same ERA5 data is
# published hourly, daily and monthly, and this figure has about five
# hundred pixels along its time axis covering four decades. Monthly is
# already finer than the plot can show.
#
# Reading the hourly store and averaging it down would move seven hundred
# times the bytes to draw exactly the same picture.

# ## What to read off it
#
# The top panel is the seasonal cycle: large and antisymmetric in the
# extratropics, small in the tropics, and larger in the northern hemisphere
# than the southern one, which is the land-ocean contrast showing up as
# thermal inertia. None of that is new, and that is the point. It is a check
# that the pipeline is telling the truth before you point it at something
# you do not already know the answer to.
#
# The bottom panel is where the seasonal cycle has been taken out, and the
# warming is visible as the red shifting rightwards, strongest at the
# northern high latitudes. Whether you call that Arctic amplification or an
# artefact of the reanalysis' changing observing system over four decades is
# a question this figure cannot answer, and a good reason to be careful with
# trends drawn from it.
#
# Swapping `ring` for a longitude bin from the
# [meridional mean](05_meridional_mean.md) gives the tropical Hovmöller that
# convection people actually want, with the same twenty lines.
